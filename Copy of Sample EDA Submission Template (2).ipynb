Optimize Pricing Strategy**\n","- **Target Affordable Price Ranges:** Listings with moderate pricing tend to attract more reviews and frequent bookings.

Enhance marketing efforts or provide unique experiences to attract a niche clientele.\n","\n","### **2. Focus on High-Demand Areas**\n","- **Maximize Presence in Manhattan and Brooklyn:** These neighborhoods have the highest engagement (reviews per month).

Avoid overly extended availability for listings with limited demand.\n","- **Seasonal Adjustments:** Use historical data to align availability and pricing with peak tourist seasons to maximize occupancy and revenue.\n","\n","### **5.
